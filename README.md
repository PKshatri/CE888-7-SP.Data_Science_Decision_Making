LSTM model on multi modal sensor dataset for continuous stress detection of nurses in a hospital (Assignment)

Data loaded from URL = 'https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.5hqbzkh6f'

The files,
'1. Extract ZIP.py'
'2. Extract Patient Data.py'
'3. Merge Patiend Data.py'
'4. Labelling merged Patient Data.py'
Must be run sequentially for the files to be extracted properly.

'Data_exploration.ipynb'
Contains the descriptive analysis and visual analysis of data for patient '5C'.

'Assignment.ipynb'
Contain the LSTM model for classification.
It is in 'ipynb' format because google collab offers GPU runtime for faster processing.
